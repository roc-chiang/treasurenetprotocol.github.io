# What is a Producer

Producers are real world economic contributors, providing physical or digital assets production records to Treasurenet to be audited and recorded on-chain.

For example, a Producer can be a bulk commodity company that produces physical products; it can also be a "miner" of scarce cryptocurrency.

In fact, any real-world asset that is quantifiable by hardware and has observable market price may qualify.
