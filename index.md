# Introduction

Treasurenet Protocol is the first Layer 1 blockchain protocol that is creating an on-chain economic system, based on real-world rare assets.

Treasurenet creates an audited, transparent, and secure way of interacting with real-world assets, paving the way for a more robust and reliable financial future in a truly decentralized manner with complete ownership and privacy.

The core objective is to achieve complete integration between the digital and physical economies by introducing a hybrid medium of stored value called the **$UNIT** token. Through this, we aim to establish a unified WEB3 financial system that seamlessly combines the strengths of both digital and physical assets.

_Note: Docs are under construction; Treasurenet Foundation welcomes discussion as we build in the open. Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/treasurenet) here and [Telegram](https://t.me/Treasurenet_io) chat here._

## Features

&rarr; **Consensus built on Real-World Assets (RWA):** First Layer 1 blockchain built on the decentralized verification of RWA productivity, where the L1 network generates UNIT token rewards based on such RWA.

&rarr; **Scalability and Performance:** Designed for Solidity and RUST compatibility and low latency, Treasurenet ensures efficient handling of real-world assets on its blockchain, paving the way for broader adoption of decentralized asset management.

&rarr; **RWA for UNIT Token Emission:** Treasurenet's protocol token, UNIT, has a finite and disinflationary supply. Block rewards emission rate is determined by RWA production rate.

&rarr; **RWA for Bonus Block Rewards:** Treasurenet employs a unique validator selection process, where validator nodes are rewarded based not only on contributions to the network but also on real-world asset production.

&rarr; **Decentralized Governance:** Treasurenet's DAO plays a crucial role in governing the platform, making decisions about key protocol parameters and interacting with the community via non-profit foundation.


This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
